A hands-on approach to the Machine Learning pipeline with Scikit-learn
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The two Jupyter interactive notebooks `sklearn-classification` and `sklearn-regression` present a hands-on introduction to the machine learning pipeline (data pre-processing, selection/assessment, different ML models) with the Scikit-learn framework.
In addition to describing the main components of the sklearn pipeline and how to put them together, each notebook offers a practical exercise to validate the knowledge acquired by the student.

To run the notebooks, a Python environment with the sklearn and jupyter libraries is required.
You can find detailed instructions to setup such an environment here: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html, and here: https://jupyter.org/install.
